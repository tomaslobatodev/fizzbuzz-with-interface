# FizzBuzz with interface
When you input a number and press the submit button you're going to get in return a list of all the numbers from 1 to the number you inputted. 
If the number is divisible by 3 instead of that number you'll get a "Fizz", if it's divisble by 5 you'll get a "Buzz", and if it's divisble by both you'll get a "FizzBuzz"
